# Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of the project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies.
We first cleaning and process the database, structure the dataframe, clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means, visualizing the results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.

## Result

**To get the k-Mean, we use the Elbow cruve**

(k-mena is 4)

**3D-Scatter plot with clusters**
